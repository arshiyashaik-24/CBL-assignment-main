## 🎮 Overview  
**Keys of Survival** is a lane-based survival game set in a **zombie apocalypse**, developed as part of the **Challenge-Based Learning (CBL)** project for the course *Programming (2IP90)* at the **Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)**.  

Players must **run through three (or more!) lanes**, **collect keys**, and **unlock matching doors** to save survivors — all while avoiding zombies and managing limited health. Each run tests quick thinking, timing, and adaptability in an unpredictable environment.  

---

## 🧩 Core Gameplay Summary  
- **Lane Movement:** Move left and right using arrow keys. Smooth, responsive control ensures intuitive gameplay.  
- **Doors & Keys System:** Collect color-coded keys and unlock corresponding doors. The wrong key or no key ends the run.  
- **Zombies:** Randomly spawned obstacles that instantly end the game on collision.  
- **Health & Revival:** Earn +1 health for every 5 doors opened. Spend 3 health points to revive after death.  
- **HUD & Scoring:** Track distance, doors opened, survivors saved, and current health in real-time.

## 🧠 Advanced Topics: Random Generation & UX  

### **1. Random Generation (Algorithmic Fairness & Replayability)**  
Random generation was implemented to ensure **each playthrough feels unique** and unpredictable.  
- Keys, doors, and zombies are all placed procedurally within three lanes using randomized logic.  
- Placement algorithms guarantee **fair and solvable runs**, avoiding impossible scenarios (e.g., blocked paths or missing key-door pairs).  
- This demonstrates understanding of **advanced programming concepts** such as **state checking**, **object mapping**, and **algorithmic fairness**.  
- From a player’s perspective, it ensures lasting engagement, no two runs are ever the same.  

### **2. User Experience (UX Design Principles)**  
A major design focus was on **clarity, responsiveness, and feedback**.  
- The **HUD** provides immediate visual feedback on keys, health, and score, ensuring players always understand their status.  
- **Color-coded doors and keys** enhance recognition and reduce cognitive load during fast gameplay.  
- **Player and door animations** and **background design** reinforce immersion without cluttering the screen.  
- Overall, UX principles guide the game’s structure, players must feel in control, informed, and motivated.

## ⚡ Progression & Difficulty  
- The game’s **speed multiplier** increases steadily (×2 → ×5) over time, requiring faster reactions.  
- **New door colors** are introduced at timed intervals to increase complexity.  
- These mechanics create a balanced difficulty curve that evolves with the player’s performance.

## 🎯 Mini Games  
To expand gameplay variety and demonstrate modular programming, several themed **mini-games** are included:  
- 🎯 **Archery**  
- 🪢 **Pull the Rope**  
- ❌⭕ **Tic Tac Toe**  
- 🍓 **Tap Match Fruits**  
- 🔌 **Connect Wires**  
- 🔘 **Button Sequence**  

Each mini-game connects to the survival theme and explores different logic and interaction mechanics.

## 🎨 Visual & Audio Design  
- Post-apocalyptic backgrounds with muted tones and fog effects.  
- Color-coded keys and doors maintain clarity and contrast.  
- Sprite animations and eerie background enhance immersion and atmosphere.
